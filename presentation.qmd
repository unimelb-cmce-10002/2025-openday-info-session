\textit{The most powerful person in the room is now the one who understands and interprets the data — that can be you}

It combines:

* The mindset of a **problem-solver**
* The tools of a **data analyst**
* The clarity of a **good communicator**

\vspace{0.5cm}

We use it to:

1. Spot patterns
2. Predict outcomes
3. Test ideas
4. Challenge assumptions

## How you will learn Business Analytics 

You will learn how to answer "**\alert{What if}** questions" across a wide range of business disciplines where ...

1. The future *is* like the past - i.e. Predictive Analytics

2. The future *is not* like the past - i.e. Causal Analytics

Using a toolkit of:

- **Technical programming skills** — so you can do the analysis
- **Communication skills** — so you can explain results to people who don't speak code

To ultimately become:

1. A \alertc{\textbf{business scientist}} — someone who thinks critically with data; and

2. A \alertc{\textbf{data interpreter}} — someone who translates complexity into clarity

## More Than Just Using 'Tools'

**Student Expectations**:

- How to write code  
- How to build charts  
- How to fit models  

**\alert{Versus Reality}**: 

Using data to **\alertc{tackle messy, ambiguous, and important}** business problems.

This version of reality requires:

- Judgement  
- Sharp, answerable questions  
- Knowing which tools to use—and when

## So What About AI?

AI can (usually) write code, generate charts, and surface patterns. But it can’t:

- Understand business context  
- Judge what matters  
- Navigate politics or ambiguity  
- Communicate with nuance  


Implication: AI can help spot patterns—but **only people know what they mean, why they matter, and what to do next**.

Learn how to use AI as a **tool**, not a replacement
 
* Good analysts use AI to work faster—**not to think less**.

## Complementary to Other Majors & Employable

\begin{center}

\textbf{\alert{Business Analytics is the glue that brings theory and evidence \\ together within the BCom}}
\end{center}

It gives you the tools to **ask smarter questions** and **back up your ideas** with evidence — no matter your major.

- Marketers test campaigns
- Finance students model risk
- Economists simulate policy
- HR Managers optimize employee performance

Graduates are **highly employable** across a range of fields
